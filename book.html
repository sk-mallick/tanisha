          Tumhari zulfein jab hawa mein lehraati hain, toh lagta hai jaise chandni raaton ka ek haseen sapna ho. Woh
          halki si adaa, woh beparwah andaaz, jaise koi geet jo sirf dil sun sakta hai. Tumhari zulfon ki mehak, ek aisi
          mehsoos karne wali baat hai jo dil ko sukoon de jaaye. Jab tumhare baalon se khelti hawa unhein aur bhi
          madhosh bana deti hai, tab lagta hai jaise waqt ek pal ke liye tham gaya ho, sirf tumhari khoobsurti ko
          mehsoos karne ke liye.
